# Data Science

My always expanding collection of data science related projects plus smaller tidbits for fun and learning.

### Summary:

[Small Box Sales Forecast:](./small-box-sales-fcst)

Ongoing work to forecast weekly sales for a local, boutique retailer.  This is part one of a larger project to forecast product inventory and automate re-stocking orders.

[NFL:](./nfl)

A fun Sunday pre-game exercise to scrape the current player rosters for each team from nfl.com and do a simple exercise of classiflying players as linemen or wide receivers based on height and weight using logistic regression. A great [MIT Opencourseware video](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-0002-introduction-to-computational-thinking-and-data-science-fall-2016/lecture-videos/lecture-10-understanding-experimental-data-cont./) inspired me to do this. I was really surprised that there are almost 2,000 active players in the NFL.

[Gradient Descent:](./gradient-descent)

Gradient descent is how you minimize cost functions in everything from linear regression to neural networks used in deep learning. Since it's so important, I thought it would be worth the time to learn and implement it from scratch again.

[Fun and Learning](./fun-and-learning)

A large and growing collection, mostly of Jupyter Notebooks, with fun exercies, labs and mini-projects from sources like Harvard's CS109 online class, etc. Notebooks on everyting from data wrangling, SQL, EDA, classification, regression and unsupervised learning are here.
